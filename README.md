A collection of useful .bat files

* cupally.bat - Runs an update of all chocolatey packages (I use this on start-up)
* gnu.bat - opens a modified cmd with access to GNU CoreUtils (http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/coreutils.htm) for text manipulation
* install.bat - to be put in git repos, for installing composer and node packages automatically on windows
